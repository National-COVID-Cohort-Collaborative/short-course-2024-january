## Materials for your future N3C project

* Sample Publication
  * Preview the [pdf](n3c-sample-publication.pdf) now during class
    (but note that Jerrod's comments in the margin don't appear in the pdf)
  * Use the [docx](n3c-sample-publication.docx) as a starting point for your writing later
    (click the "View raw" link on the next page to download it)

* Resources for future learning
  * [_The Researcherâ€™s Guide to N3C: A National Resource for Analyzing Real-World Health Data_](https://national-covid-cohort-collaborative.github.io/guide-to-n3c-v1/)

    We hope this book serves as the first stop to learn about N3C.
    In other words, all the relevant N3C resources distributed across the internet are listed in
    this book and placed into the larger context.

    Now that students have invested 12+ hours into N3C, we humbly invite your perspective.
    If you see something missing or something that can be added, please follow the suggestions in the
    [How to Contribute](https://national-covid-cohort-collaborative.github.io/guide-to-n3c-v1/#sec-welcome-contribute)
    section.
