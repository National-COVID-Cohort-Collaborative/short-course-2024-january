* [Assignment 2](session-2-assignment.pdf)

Within this session, there is a demo for an interactive E-R Diagram and a subset of the OMOP vocabulary tables for querying in a [Shiny app](https://anzalone23.shinyapps.io/n3c-short-course/) with a SQLite backend. You can clone that portion within this repository and run it locally in RStudio. To do so, open the [shiny-demo](/sessions/session-2/shiny-demo/) directory in RStudio, download the latest version of the Shiny package, and click the 'Run App' option to launch the app locally. This will allow you to follow along with the exercises above.
