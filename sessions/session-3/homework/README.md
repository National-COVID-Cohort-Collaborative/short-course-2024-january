Session 3 Homework
==============================

Session 3 has two assignments:
1. [Before Session 3 Starts](#before-session-3-starts)
1. [After Session 3 Ends](#after-session-3-ends)


Before Session 3 Starts
------------------------------

Before Session 3, please create four Code Workbooks.
The first three steps resemble the [Week 1 Assignment](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/short-course-2024-january/blob/main/sessions/session-1/session-1-assignment.pdf)
so refer to that if you forgot some steps.

### Log into the Enclave and create your personal directory for this class.
1.  Log in to the Enclave, with MFA.
1.  In our class's [L0
    workspace](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/compass/view/ri.compass.main.folder.86a7020f-db30-4fd1-b735-bbaf53512365),
    open to the "Users/" directory and create your personal folder.
    (if it doesn't already exist).
    For directory & file names, I like [kebab
    case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/#kebab-case)
     (eg, "will-beasley", jerrod-anzalone", "james-cheng").

### Create the `manipulation-1` Code Workbook

1.  Make sure you're in the root of your personal directory.
1.  Create a new "Code Workbook".
1.  Once the workbook opens, rename it to "manipulation-1".
    Then say, "Rename" when it asks,
    "Also rename the output folder to `manipulation-1`?"
    (Rename the workbook once it's open, so these behind-the-scenes files are appropriately adjusted.)
1.  Change the environment.
    1.  In the top center of the screen, click the lightning bolt near
        "Environment (default-r-3.5)"
    1.  Click "Configure Environment"
    1.  In the left-hand Profiles panel, click
        "profile-high-driver-cores-and-memory-*limited*". (Remarks that
        will make sense later: \#1 For workbooks that rely on R, we'll
        chose "r4-high-driver-memory". \#2 We're using small datasets
        this session; use more memory for real projects, such as
        "profile-high-driver-cores-and-memory".)
    1.  Click the blue "Update Environment" button.
    1.  Wait a few minutes, or go back to the directory screen and continue creating workbooks.
        It take the servers a few minutes to create environment.

### Create the `graphs-1` Code Workbook

1. Follow the same steps as `manipulation-1`, except
1. Rename it `graphs-1` and
1. Choose the "r4-high-driver-memory" environment.

### Create the `validation-1` Code Workbook

1. Follow the same steps as `manipulation-1`, except
1. Rename it `validation-1` and
1. Choose the "r4-high-driver-memory" environment.

### Create the `modeling-1` Code Workbook

1. Follow the same steps as `manipulation-1`, except
1. Rename it `modeling-1` and
1. Choose the "r4-high-driver-memory" environment.
