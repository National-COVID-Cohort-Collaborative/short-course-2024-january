# Data Extraction & Assembly with Synthetic Data

Feb 1, 2024

Combining multiple OMOP tables into a single R data frame that can be
analyzed.

This is part of the [Analysis with Synthetic Data](../) session.

## Important Terminology for this Lesson

- *table grain*: what one row in a table represents. For example, the
  grain of the
  [`person`](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm60.html#PERSON)
  table is “person”; each row represents one distinct person/patient..
  Similarly, the grain of the
  [`visit_occurrence`](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm60.html#VISIT_OCCURRENCE)
  table is “visit”; each row represents one distinct visit/encounter the
  patient had with the health system..

## Start a “Code Workbook” in the Foundry Enclave

1.  In our class’s [L0
    workspace](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/compass/view/ri.compass.main.folder.86a7020f-db30-4fd1-b735-bbaf53512365),
    open to the “Users/” directory and create your personal folder. I
    like [kebab
    case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/#kebab-case)
    for directory & file names (eg, “will-beasley” or
    “jerrod-anzalone”).
2.  Create a new “Code Workbook”.
3.  Once the workbook opens, rename it to “manipulation-1”. (Rename it
    once it’s open, so some behdin-the-scenes files are approrpiately
    adjusted.)
4.  Change the environment.
    1.  In the top center of the screen, click the lightning bolt near
        “Enviroment (default-r-3.5)”
    2.  Click “Configure Environment”
    3.  In the left-hand Profiles panel, click “r4-high-driver-memory”
    4.  Click the blue “Update Environment” button and wait a few
        minutes.
5.  It will take the servers a few minutes to create environments for
    all of us. So let’s talk concepts next.

## Identify Source Tables & their Relationships

- In most EHR research, conceputally start with the database’s patient.
  With OMOP, this table is called
  [`person`](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm60.html#PERSON).

- But with N3C, a talented group of peopled have Almost always start
  with a patient-grained
