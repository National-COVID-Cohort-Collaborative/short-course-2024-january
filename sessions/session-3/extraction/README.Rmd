Data Extraction & Assembly with Synthetic Data
============

Feb 1, 2024

Combining multiple OMOP tables into a single R data frame that can be analyzed.

This is part of the [Analysis with Synthetic Data](../) session.


Start a "Code Workbook" in the Foundry Enclave
--------------------

1. In our class's [L0 workspace](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/compass/view/ri.compass.main.folder.86a7020f-db30-4fd1-b735-bbaf53512365),
   open to the "Users/" directory and create your personal folder.
   I like [kebab case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/#kebab-case)
   for directory & file names (eg, "will-beasley" or "jerrod-anzalone").
1. Create a new "Code Workbook".
1. Once the workbook opens, rename it to "manipulation".
   (Rename it once it's open, so some behdin-the-scenes files are approrpiately adjusted.)
1. Change the environment.
   1. In the top center of the screen, click the lightning bolt near "Enviroment (default-r-3.5)"
   1. Click "Configure Environment"
   1. In the left-hand Profiles panel, click "r4-high-driver-memory"
   1. Click the blue "Update Environment" button and wait a few minutes.
      It will take the servers a few minutes to create environments for all of us.
