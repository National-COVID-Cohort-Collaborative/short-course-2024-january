Data Extraction & Assembly with Synthetic Data
============

Feb 1, 2024

Combining multiple OMOP tables into a single R data frame that can be analyzed.

This is part of the [Analysis with Synthetic Data](../) session.

Important Terminology for this Lesson
--------------------

* *table grain*: what one row in a table represents.
  For example, the grain of the [`person`](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm60.html#PERSON) table is "person";
  each row represents one distinct person/patient.
  Similarly, the grain of the [`visit_occurrence`](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm60.html#VISIT_OCCURRENCE) table is "visit";
  each row represents one distinct visit/encounter the patient had with the health system..

Start a "Code Workbook" in the Foundry Enclave
--------------------

1. In our class's [L0 workspace](https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/compass/view/ri.compass.main.folder.86a7020f-db30-4fd1-b735-bbaf53512365),
   open to the "Users/" directory and create your personal folder.
   I like [kebab case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/#kebab-case)
   for directory & file names (eg, "will-beasley", "jerrod-anzalone", "james-cheng").
1. Create a new "Code Workbook".
1. Once the workbook opens, rename it to "manipulation-1".
   (Rename it once it's open, so some behdin-the-scenes files are approrpiately adjusted.)
1. Change the environment.
   1. In the top center of the screen, click the lightning bolt near "Enviroment (default-r-3.5)"
   1. Click "Configure Environment"
   1. In the left-hand Profiles panel, click "r4-high-driver-memory"
   1. Click the blue "Update Environment" button and wait a few minutes.
1. It will take the servers a few minutes to create environments for all of us.
   So let's talk concepts next.

Challenge for Today's Session
--------------------

* Investigate the observational relationship between covid outcomes and
  * pecked by chicken, initial encounter ([W61.33XA](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/V00-Y99/W50-W64/W61-/W61.33XA))

  * struck by a chicken, initial encounter ([W61.32XA](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/V00-Y99/W50-W64/W61-/W61.32XA))
  * struck by a duck, initial encounter ([W61.62XA](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/V00-Y99/W50-W64/W61-/W61.62XA))

* In OMOP, ICD codes are translated to SNOMED codes, and can lose some granularity.

Identify Source Tables & their Relationships
--------------------

* In most EHR research, conceputally start with the database's patient.
  With OMOP, this table is called [`person`](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm60.html#PERSON).

* But with N3C, a talented group of people have faced and addressed many of the problems we'll face.
  So let's leverage the [Logic Liaisons'](https://covid.cd2h.org/liaisons/) contributions to the N3C Knowledge Store.

* [OMOP Table Structure](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm60.html#Clinical_Data_Tables)
